Whether you're [building the Enterprise](http://www.buildtheenterprise.org) or you just want to hold LCARS in the palm of your hands, you're in the right place.
This project is built on top of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap), [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com).
